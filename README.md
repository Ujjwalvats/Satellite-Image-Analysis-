In our country we get to see every year that many people die due to not having proper amount of food and many Farmers commit 
Suicide since they failed to cultivate crops and get trapped in heavy debt. But what if the food that will produce in 
coming year is already known by doing analysis based on previous year data. By this we can make a proper storage of food, 
if it is known that next year not much food will be produced and can save our country from starvation.
However this is already being done manually, record is maintained of food produced and the need of country.
This work till certain extent only and what we are doing is a computer based analysis by which everyone get to know how 
much supply of food is there and if we share our analysis everybody will be aware about our country agriculture production.

Our project Titled Satellite Imagery Analysis for Predicting Food Supply in our country is all about fetching the data in the form of image from various website which provides satellite image for use. After getting the data cleaning of dirty data is done which is followed by initial analysis and then building a predictive model. Pixel from the imad for doing further analysis. We will also show an area in our country where there is huge agriculture
production and an area where the same is less.The whole concept of the project is based on the data science and various types of data analytics technique will be used in our project.
Tools which we are using for our project is R Studio for doing R programming, Tableau for getting initial overview of our country food supply data and if possible we would like to present our project in the form of web report. In R studio we will analyze different form of the Image data and see the color correlation within different images. We will use Windows environment to run all required software. We will make use of various R packages to do our project.
We will analyze the Image data based on vegetation that is greenery. More the vegetation more will be the food produced and vice versa. The Vegetation could definitely contribute the impact to the annual agricultural production. That is why we have chosen vegetation as a parameter to judge greenness and hence agricultural production.
